🚀 Featured Capstone Projects
Project 10: COVID-19 Data Visualization
Keywords: Matplotlib, Time-Series Analysis, Rolling Averages, Data Viz.

Objective: Analyzed CDC COVID-19 death statistics to visualize regional impacts and national trends.

Implementation: Built a visualization suite that generates time-series scatter plots with 7, 30, and 90-day moving averages and custom-binned histograms for state-specific frequency profiling.

Tech: Matplotlib (Agg backend), Pandas aggregation.

Project 09: TomTom API Integration
Keywords: REST APIs, Geocoding, Exponential Backoff, Requests.

Objective: Developed a resilient toolkit for Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding using the TomTom Search API.

Implementation: Features smart URL encoding for special characters, automated retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limits, and secure API key management via .env files.

Tech: Requests, JSON parsing, python-dotenv.

Project 07-08: Data Wrangling & ETL Toolkit
Keywords: Pandas, Regex, Data Engineering, ETL.

Objective: Built high-performance tools for real-world data cleaning and restructuring.

Implementation: Includes multi-file consolidation with automated 60/40 train/test splits, long-to-wide data pivoting, and coordinate extraction from strings using complex Regular Expressions.

Tech: Pandas, Regex (re), OS automation.

Project 05-06: Object-Oriented Queuing Library
Keywords: OOP, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Lazy Evaluation.

Objective: Designed a professional class hierarchy to model various queuing systems (M/M/1, M/M/c, M/G/1).

Implementation: Utilized an Abstract Base Class (ABC) with a "dirty flag" state management system to optimize performance via lazy evaluation.

Tech: Python OOP (Inheritance/Properties), NumPy.

Project 01-04: Mathematical & Procedural Logic
Keywords: Poisson Distributions, Priority Queues, Little's Law.

Objective: Implemented the fundamental mathematical logic for steady-state queuing and probability distributions.

Implementation: Programmed derivations for priority-class waiting times and system occupancy metrics.
